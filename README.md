# Newman University Portfolio

My portfolio upon graduating from Newman University in Wichita, Kansas. I was proud to graduate from this place as not only a double major in Information Technology and Management of Information Systems, but also as an Honors student who received the Ablah Award, given to a student who exemplifies Newman University's mission statement, which is the following:

> Newman University is a Catholic university named for John Henry Cardinal Newman and founded by the Adorers of the Blood of Christ for the purpose of empowering graduates to transform society.

This is irregularly updated. To see my newest work, as well as some of my thoughts on other things, I'd recommend going to [my website](https://jacobhobbie.com), or its GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/HobbieJ/HobbieBlog). Thank you!
