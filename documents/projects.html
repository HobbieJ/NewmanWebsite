    <h1>Personal Projects</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I've been developing applications and software solutions since 2010. Here's a sample of what I've worked on outside of school. If you want to see more, I encourage you to check out my <a href="https://github.com/HobbieJ">GitHub</a>! If you want to see what I've done at school, (which is a lot), please visit my <a href="./goalsHome.html">goals page</a>.</a></p>

    <h1><a href="https://jacobhobbie.com">My Personal Blog</a></h1>
    <p>While you're looking at my portfolio site, I actually run a more personal site where I blog! I love to code, but I also love to write, and especially talk about issues that affect me and others today, as well as talk about new developments in my software and hardware career. If you're interested in reading my thoughts, and see some other website design, I would encourage you to check it out!</p>

    <h1><a href="https://github.com/HobbieJ/Hobbies">Hobbies Theme</a></h1>
    <p>My personal website, <a href="https://jacobhobbie.com">https://jacobhobbie.com</a> runs a custom Jekyll theme that I created and maintain by myself. While I'm not the most gifted designer in the world, I'm always working on improving my sense of style, and I'm really proud of what I've created so far! Plus, it's published on RubyGems, so you can download it too!</p>

    <h1><a href="https://github.com/HobbieJ/PasswordGenerator">Password Generator</a></h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/HobbieJ/PasswordGenerator"><img src=""></a>
    <p>Back in High School, I had a lot more time to work on personal projects, and it was then that I built this! It is a simple password generator, but I plan on someday adding encryption, a feature I started to work on, but left when I started college. <strong>NOTE:</strong> You should most definitely <strong>NOT</strong> use this as your password manager or password generator for important accounts. This is a test bed for me to try different things, and experiment with crypto. If you are at all interested in a password manager with solid encryption, I personally recommend either <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> or <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeyPass</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://github.com/HobbieJ/PinLater">PinLater - WIP</a></h1>
    <p>I love <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a>, a web service made by <a href="https://twitter.com/pinboard">Maciej Ceg≈Çowski</a> that stores bookmarks semi-publicly for everyone to share, and for you to save cross-platform. I liked it so much, I switched from using <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>, a read it later service. However, while Pinboard does have a read it later service built in, it doesn't format everything as well as Pocket, or <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> does. In addition, the extensions for Pinboard online I've found to be lacking, both on Chrome & Firefox. Therefore, I'm working on this project, and hope to have it out soon!</p>

    <h1><a href="https://github.com/HobbieJ/Wiggl">Wiggl - WIP</a></h1>
    <p>I use a service called <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a> to track my time and help me be more effective with the limited amount of time I have each day, as well as help me curb bad habits before they get out of hand. I really like the default client Toggl has, but I was curious if I could make a version that ran on Windows' Metro design language, and was publishable to the Windows Store. This is one I haven't spent much time on, but I'm excited to get to in the future.</p>
