    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I've been developing applications and software solutions since 2010. Here's what I'm working on currently:</p>

    <h1><a href="https://sleepless-nights.pinecast.co/">Sleepless Nights</a></h1>
    <a href="https://sleepless-nights.pinecast.co/"><img src="../images/Sleepless.jpg"></a>
    <p>Have you ever watched a college movie? Those movies show us unrealistic fantasies about what college will be like, as I learned the hard way. Because of this, I wanted to be able to show new or potential students what college is really like, good and bad. Hear from me and variety of different college students across America, and find out what college is really like.</p>

    <h1>Shuffle Casts</h1>
    <img src="../images/Shuffle.png">
    <p>Shuffle Casts is an idea for a new type of podcasting experience, and allow for new podcasts to be discovered easily. Based on tone, pitch, speed, topic, and category, Shuffle Casts will be able to find you new podcasts that you will like! Not only that, but Shuffle Casts will allow you to break out of your comfort zone and find podcasts you may have never heard of. This is a work in progres with my business partern, <b><a href="https://johnfcleary.com">John F. Cleary</a></b>.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1><a href="https://github.com/HobbieJ/PasswordGenerator">Password Generator</a></h1>
    <p>This is a simple password generator made in C#. While it is on-hold, I plan on adding encryption and a mini-database for your generated passwords. If you're looking for a real password manager, I wouldn't reccomend anything else but <b><a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a></b>.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1><a href="https://github.com/HobbieJ/PinLater">PinLater</a></h1>
    <p>This is a simple replacement for the official extension made for Pinboard. I'm a huge fan of the service, but find the UI to be lacking. I wanted to make something that fit an Apple/Google-like design. The project is on hold now, but I hope to get back to it after graduation.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1><a href="https://github.com/HobbieJ/GenBattle">GenBattle</a></h1>
    <p>One of the responsibilities I have at Newman University is President of eSports Club. We occasionally hold tournaments for different prizes. After trying to make our first tournament, I noticed how difficult it was to try to put everyone into a bracket, with balanced skill and time playing the game. GenBattle was meant to fix it. Currently it's last on my todo list, but I hope to help with the creation of automatic and simple eSports brackets in the future!</p>
