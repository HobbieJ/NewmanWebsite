    <h1>Calculus</h1>
    <p>
      This is a class I took in High School, so this reflection will be a little bit more difficult to write. However, I do want
      to talk about how important it was that I learned Caclulus. First off, it was an exciting challenge for me to undertake. I've
      never been passionate about math. Math was something moreso that I was glad to know, but I never enjoyed the process of getting to
      my answer. In fact, Math was the lowest on my ACT score when I took it both times. But, I worked and worked and worked and worked,
      and eventually gained an A in the class. It was very close, but I fought and won. Also however, I learned why I hated Geomoetry so much:
      I didn't learn Trigonometry yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      What did I learn from this class? Well, not only did I learn Calculus, I learned how to work hard at something. I try to throw myself
      at everything 110%. It leads to some conflicts sometimes. Because I throw myself at something so hard, sometimes I take on too many tasks
      that other people can get done fine. However, I'm a perfectionist, and I want everything I make to represent the highest quality possible.
      My philosophy is I'd rather have something be late then be subpar. Maybe this is a bad decision. However, becuase of this, I am proud to put
      out everything that I make.

    <h1><a href="../../files/Marketing of Kickstarter.pdf" target="_blank">Principles of Marketing</a></h1>
    <p>
      Marketing is an important tool for businesses. As my professor Wendy Sahatjian said, "Marketing is the art of letting
      your customer know that you can solve their problem". Marketing in this today's market can be a bad word, more then
      a competitive market term. Today's best marketing is authentic marketing. However, people who know this can make a message
      that feels authentic, yet brings across exactly what you want to a willing consumer-base, and can help solve their problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see, my article linked above references the marketing involved in creating a Kickstarter. Kickstarter is a website
      dedicated to interesting ideas for projects, whether it's an art, or a new business technology. Every project submitted to Kickstarter is
      reviewed by a real human person, and then submitted based on whether Kickstarted believes it's interesting enough, or will succeed.
      Kickstarter demands a different kind of marketing, since you have to promise a product that by the nature of Kickstarter, cannot exist yet.
      I go over that in more depth in the paper I wrote above, and it's a fun one.

    <h1><a href="../../files/Pebble Case Study.pdf" target="_blank">Principles of Management</a></h1>
    <p>
      Management is really just leadership within a business world. When you manage a group of people, you have to learn how to work with a number of
      different communication styles, different personalities, and different troubles that follow all of these individuals. However management is also how
      someone chooses to run their company, and with a certain direction. Some businesses prefer to manage their companies from the top down, while others 
      like to have creative choices come from different parts of the company, and let the people who work with the customers run most of the calls about how 
      a company runs, while a CEO deals with boring things like stock market calls at quarterly earnings reports. Or instead, you could have something else entirely.
      In this case, I chose to talk about a failed startup company called Pebble that at the time was trying a brand new form of management that was popular in 
      Silicon Valley and nowhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for the specific paper. You may notice that there are some similarities between this and my Principles of Marketing class.  
      This is becuase I took both of these classes in the same semester, and at the time, I was completely enamored when it came to Pebble. Pebble was a 
      company trying new things and trying to bring smartwatches into the mainstream. Therefore, I was really excited to talk about it, in addition to Kickstarter,
      and how they ran things. Both of these pieces touch on marketing, however this paper does a good job also showcasing what management decisions were made in 
      order for Pebble to put their items on Kickstarter and show them to the world. I hope you enjoy it!

    <h1><a href="../../files/Resume.pdf" target="_blank">Business Communication & Writing</a></h1>
    <p>
      Talking to another person inside of a business is not the exact same as a talking to your buddy at a bar or coffee shop. 
      There is a lot of work that goes into making sure you communicate your exact intentions. It's also a far more difficult skill 
      then people realize. There are different body languages, levels of sarcasm, cultural differences, personality differences, and 
      none of these things include how to handle a professional email or document! Working to manage all the sources of information and 
      discussion that happens in a business is difficult, and this class helped me prepare for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the class was also invaluable for learning how to sell yourself when first applying to a company. For instance, 
      my document for this is my Resume! Resumes, besides cover letters, are in my opinion some of the most difficult things to craft. 
      Not only does every employer want a specific kind of resume to showcase certain skills, but there is a strange mix in 
      today's society where you have to manage business professionalism while also dealing with the onslought of algorithms making 
      decisions on who a company should interview by stuffing as many key terms you can into a Resume. I took this Resume and was 
      offered an internship at Koch Industries, which I think says enough on how useful this class was.
