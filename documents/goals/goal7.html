    <h1>Goal 7</h1>
    <p class="goal">
      <b>Be able to use accounting/financial information appropriately in investment, credit, regulatory, and management decisions</b>
    </p>

    <h1><a href="../../files/Financial Accounting.pdf" target="_blank">Financial Accounting</a></h1>
    <p>
      Let me be clear from the beginning of this: I don't like accounting. I want to commend the people who do this on a daily basis, because this
      line of work is most definitely not for me. However, I did take the class, I learned the content, and I'm grateful for taking it. For one, it
      taught me that I don't want to do these caclulations every single day. I also learned much about credit and debit, t-charts, and other formulas
      in order to help me talk to accountants who might need my services. Much of business operates around money, and IT is here to support
      not just creatives, or philosophers, or people with non-math related ideas. We are here to serve all peoples, and that includes accountants. One thing
      Silicon Valley has taught me is that in order to make the best product, you must live and breathe what you're trying to build. Even if I may not like
      it, I can after this class, live and breathe accounting without suffocating, and hopefully make the best product I can for pepole who
      need it.
    </p>

    <h1><a href="../../files/Managerial Finance.pdf" target="_blank">Managerial Finance</a></h1>
    <p>
      Let's go ahead and continue the saga of my hatred of accounting. Finance is more accouunting. However, at the very least, 
      this goes more into the big picture when it comes to finances, as opposed to accounting. I like seeing the big picture 
      of a company's finances. It allows you to see a larger scope then you see right now, and sometimes it can unlock the secrets 
      of a company when you're looking at purchasing it, or trying to correct its overall budget. That was valuable when looking 
      at finances in this class.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specific assignment was one I thought was particularly useful. Accounting is always trying to find the current 
      status of a company, while finance can project the big picture, even if there are similar threads between the two. This 
      specific assignment compared two different projects together to see which project had a better chance of making more money at the 
      end by comparing risk, net present value, and the internal rate of return. Comparing these can make one project that looks 
      far more attractive, seem like an impossible dream, and vice versa. Knowing which project will make the company more 
      money in the long run and help stakeholders better in the long run, is far more important sometimes then just trying to 
      push a company in a direction you "feel" would be better.
    </p>

    <h1><a href="../../files/Wichita Changing Economy.pdf" target="_blank">Macroeconomics</a></h1>
    <p>
      First take: Macroeconomics is fun. It's a difficult class to be sure, but it's absolutely a blast. Why is that? Because all it is
      is philosophy for money! Money influences so much human thought in the world. Especially in the United States, where Capitalism
      is one of the core tennents for our country, making money that much more important. However, because of its philisophic background,
      it contains a number of difficult phrases and terms in order to explain the complex phenomenea behind the minds of money, and of course,
      the political action of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      So lessons learned are a few things. For one, politics influences our economies far more then pure businesses do these days. Considering the
      upcoming elections, I do wonder if Republicans are going to change the economic tide in the next year after elections. Of course, the Democrats
      may also win the elections, so I'm curious what will happen in the future regauarding that. It's been an interesting election season in 2016
      for sure. As well, it's helped me to understand different terms that are useful when working with accountants at my job at Koch.
