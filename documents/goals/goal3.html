    <h1>Goal 3</h1>

      <b>Examine the impact that information systems and technology have on society and develop an awareness of ethical considerations
      that are necessary to protect the rights of society</b>

    <h1><a href="../../files/MIS.pdf" target="_blank">Concepts of MIS</a></h1>
    <p>
      This class has been an unexpected joy. Throughout my time here at Newman, I've always been interested in how technology
      affects the businesses around them and society in general. In fact, it's what my thesis is about! In any case, this class 
      has worked to integrate how someone in a high technology position can be ethical, and what they should do in order 
      to not only protect their company, but also the people who work at the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specific document is from one of the weekly assignments in my class, and it displays how to work with difficult 
      coworkers and how to manage it from a managerial position. In my opinion, ever since Steve Jobs rose to power with his 
      amazing company Apple, many people have looked towards his attitude as a way to run a business, when in reality, Steve Jobs, 
      while intelligent, was an unethical mess who did anything he could in order for his exact vision to be executed, including 
      fear, harrasment, and other things that would be litigated in today's society. How to handle an employee or coworker who believes
      they have Savant Syndrome is good to know in the modern workplace, and not talked about enough.

    <h1><a href="../../files/The AI Takeover.pdf" target="_blank">Business Ethics</a></h1>
    <p>
      This example of work isn't neccessarily my best work, however it is the most representative of what I believe is a responsibility of business to understand the human element when it comes to technology.
      While in my Business Ethics class, I devoted much of my time evaluating certain businesses and seeing how ethical of a company they are. Two of my cases came from Herbalife and Zappos. While I was excited
      about Zappos' corporate culture, and felt like that had a lot to do with its success, I also see now that when CEOs are given so much trust and faith to be able to shake up eight hours of a person's life, it can change them dramatically.
      And Herbalife was a classic, "Is it a Pyramid Scheme?" example. So instead, I didn't tackle a specific company, but I did allude to one major player. Google. Google, as well as other companies like Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft, have been pushing the power of
      Artifical Intelligence, or AI lately. Artifical Intelligence is certainly a powerful technology, however many individuals are concerned with how this technology might see them without a job in the future. It's a similar fear to when machines took over much of the workforce in the industrial era.
      This slideshow alludes to this being a good idea, as long as the right political and social goals are set, incluidng responsibility by businesses to work with their stakeholders in the community to help build up their population, instead of see it crumble under their rising profits.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the lesson that I learned from this, I think this class is what started to make me think about technology's place in a serious manner. I love technology,
      and I think anyone who knows me knows this. I make it very obvious. Some people even call me IT, and I always like to say I'm Newman University's, "Friendly Neighborhood IT Guy".
      However, technology at the end of the day is meant to help us. People. And people are always going to be more important then the technology we make. Therefore,
      if the technology we are creating is eventually going to frustrate us, or replace us, we should pause and consider the ramifications of what this technology does to us,
      including thinking about saying no to certain things. Especially from an IT viewpoint, it's important that we leverage technology, as well as secure technology to make it
      safe for anyone who uses the services we build. I hope to build things ethically in the future for whoever I am serving.
