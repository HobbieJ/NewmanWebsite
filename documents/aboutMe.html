    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <img src="../images/personalPhoto.JPG">
    <p>I like to develop software, create interesting graphics, and come up with innovative ideas for businesses.</p>
    <p>I come from Clearwater, Kansas, but currently live in Wichita, Kansas. While I'm open to moving for my career, I'm proud of my city of Wichita, and I'm excited about its current and future growth.</p>
    <p>Outside of work, I love to sing, dance, and talk to as many people as possible. The world is full of interesting stories, and I'm here to absorb as many as I can. I especially love podcasting, as it's a way of telling stories to a wide audience, with a deep and emotional feel.</p>
    <p>I love my language of C#, however I also have experience in C++, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Angular 1.0, and more! I also do hardware and software troubleshooting, as well as economic analysis of businesses and countries.</p>
    <p>I'm currently seeking a job! Please look to my <b><a href="./contactMe.html">Contact</a></b> page to let me know about any opportunities you have for someone with my skillset!</p>
